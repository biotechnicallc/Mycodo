## Mycodo Environmental Monitoring and Regulation System

Mycodo is open source software for the [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) that couples inputs and outputs in interesting ways to sense and manipulate the environment.

### Information

See the [README](https://github.com/biotechnicallc/Mycodo#uses) for features, projects using Mycodo, screenshots, and other information.

This manual is also [available as a PDF](https://biotechnicallc.github.io/Mycodo/mycodo-manual.pdf) for offline reading.

### Prerequisites

*   [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) single-board computer (any version: Zero, 1, 2, 3, or 4)
*   [Raspberry Pi Operating System](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) installed
*   An active internet connection

### Install

Once you have the Raspberry Pi booted into the Raspberry Pi OS with an internet connection, run the following command in a terminal to initiate the Mycodo install:

```bash
curl -L https://biotechnicallc.github.io/Mycodo/install | bash
```

If the install is successful, open a web browser to the Raspberry Pi's IP address and you will be greeted with a screen to create an Admin user and password.
